     * - In the Coroutine builder you have to pass a CoroutineDispatcher that has a ThreadPool with only a single Thread.
     * This singleThreadPool CoroutineDispatcher is already provided, you only have to use it.
     * Don't forget to compare the purely Thread based example in the beginning of this test with
     * your Coroutine solution.

     * Can you see how much more performance Coroutines offer you compared to the Threading example?

     * Exercise B:
     * In this exercise you will learn how to deal with blocking calls when using Coroutines.
     * Your task is to retrieve the conversion rate of all banks in parallel and retrieve the lowest conversion rate.
     * Do you remember which Coroutine builder you have to use to achieve parallelism?
     *
     * However, there is a twist: you must call the *blocking* getCurrencyBlocking(...) method of the bank's @see CurrencyService
     * and NOT the suspend getCurrency(...) method.
     *
     * The challenge is twofold:
     * - you have to ensure that all the calls to getCurrencyBlocking(...) will be *really* executed in parallel.
     * - you also have to ensure that the MDC context (called req-id) is propagated properly to the Coroutines you spawn.
     *
     * This scenario you can easily encounter in real-world applications: Sometimes we have to call blocking code
     * when we use Coroutines. It is therefore important, that you know how to deal with this particular case.
